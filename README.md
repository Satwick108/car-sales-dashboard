This is a basic excel interactive dashboard that I've made using MsExcel. 

The Car Sales Dashboard is an interactive Excel tool designed to explore car sales data by brand. Users can utilize dynamic charts and graphs to analyze sales metrics and trends.

There are some key features include interactive filters that allow users to select different car brands and view relevant data. The dashboard updates automatically to reflect the chosen brand, providing visual insights through various charts.

Users can simply open the Excel file, select a car brand from the filter, and view the updated charts and data. The dashboard uses a car sales dataset that includes information on different brands and their sales figures.
